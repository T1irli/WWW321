    <h2>My success in college</h2>
    <p>I have managed to get a higher <b>scholarship</b>, found a lot of interesting peers and spent an amazing time in a college dorm.</p>
    <h2>My disappointments about college</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, college did not bring me the knowlage that had been promised whan I was entering the college. I also understood that not all the teachers are profs in programming
       and some of them don't even know the <strong>basic things</strong>. In addition, I still don't find learning philosophy really useful for programmers. Well, I thinks some teachers are just <del>good</del> bad.</p>
    <h2><ins>The best scenes of college life</ins></h2>
    <p>I must admit, that staying up in the college dorm has given me really <i>amazing memories</i>. And I will always remember all the jokes and funny staff that my friends and I have done in the college <small>:)</small></p>
    <h2>My hopes in the college</h2>
    <p><em>Hopefully, I will at least graduate.</em></p>
    <h2>My hopes for the future</h2>
    <p>I hope to become a great junior programmer, find a job and then become a senior, maybe run my own company in the future.</p>
    <h2>I ... in 10 years</h2>
    <p>I see sfefe myself in 10 years as a great programmer that works with a great and friendly staff and get <mark>satisfaction</mark> while coding.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Self-Implementation</h3>
    <p>To become a great programmer I also attend an <code>IT accademy.</code></p>
